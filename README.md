# DxWrapper
### Introduction
DxWrapper is a .dll file designed to wrap DirectX files to fix compatibility issues in older games.  This project is primarily targeted at fixing issues with running games on Windows 10, by simply dropping .dll and .ini files into the game folder.  Its secondary purpose is to offer a single tool combining several projects into one.

### Features
DxWrapper has many features including:

 - Integration of [DDrawCompat](https://github.com/narzoul/DDrawCompat/)
 - Configuring DDrawCompat options to improve compatibility
 - Proxy for [DxWnd](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/)
 - Conversion of DirectDraw 1-6 to DirectDraw 7
 - Conversion of Direct3D 1-6 to Direct3D 7
 - Conversion of DirectDraw 1-7 (ddraw.dll) to Direct3D 9 (d3d9.dll) using [Dd7to9](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/wiki/DirectDraw-to-Direct3D9-Conversion)
 - Conversion of Direct3D 8 (d3d8.dll) to Direct3D 9 (d3d9.dll) using [d3d8to9](https://github.com/crosire/d3d8to9)
 - Conversion of DirectInput 1-7 (dinput.dll) to DirectInput 8 (dinput8.dll) using [dinputto8](https://github.com/elishacloud/dinputto8)
 - Includes [LegacyD3DResolutionHack](https://github.com/UCyborg/LegacyD3DResolutionHack) to remove the artificial resolution limit from Direct3D 1-7, which allows DirectDraw games to play at 4K resolution
 - Tweaking of Microsoft DirectSound function calls using [DSoundCtrl](http://www.bockholdt.com/dsc/)
 - Can cause DirectDraw 1-7, Direct3D 8 and Direct3D 9 games to run in windowed mode
 - Can set vertex processing and cache modes to fix perfromance in some Direct3D 9 games
 - Can remove scanlines from DirectDraw 1-7 games
 - Can disable High DPI scaling to solve issues with some games
 - Can disable Microsoft Game Explorer (GameUX) to prevent rundll32.exe high CPU
 - ASI loader to load custom libraries with the file extension .asi into game processes using [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader)
 - Supports being loaded as an ASI plug-in
 - Adding AntiAliasing support into Direct3D 8 or 9 games even if the game does not support it
 - Hot patch memory support (update game memory at run time, can be used to remove CD/DVD checks or resolve graphics or other glitches)
 - Set single CPU affinity (some games have issues with multi-core CPUs)
 - Ability to set all 12 Application Compatibility Toolkit options for DXPrimaryEmulation using SetAppCompatData API
 - Set game window to fullscreen (some games have fullscreen issues)
 - Handling in-game exceptions or crashes
 - Load custom .dll files into games
 - Run custom processes at game start-up

### Compatibility List for Games on Windows 10
So far I have tested this with hundreds of games (many of which  don't otherwise work correctly) to get them running on Windows 10.  Most games will work, but some still have issues.  Check out the [Compatible Games wiki](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/wiki/Compatible-Games) and the [Dd7to9 Supported Games wiki](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/wiki/DirectDraw-to-Direct3D9-Conversion#supported-2d-games-directdraw) for a list.

### Installation

1. Download the latest binary release from the repository's [Release](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/releases) page and unzip it to a folder.
2. Determine which .dll file is needed for the game.  This depends on many factors which will be explained on page created later.  Most commonly it is `ddraw.dll`, `dsound.dll` or `winmm.dll`.
3. Copy this .dll file from the 'Stub' folder plus the `dxwrapper.dll` and `dxwrapper.ini` files into the game's installation directory, next to the main executable file.  For some games the main executable is in a subdirectory (like 'Bin', 'Exe' or 'App') so the files will need to be copied it into that directory.  Overwriting of any existing game files is not recommended.
4. Open up the `dxwrapper.ini` file in a text editor and enable the settings needed for the game.

Do not attempt to overwrite any .dll in a Windows system directory as it is currently not supported and will not work.

### Uninstallation

Delete the DxWrapper .dll and .ini files from the game's directory. You can also delete the log file, if there is one.

### Configuration

To configure DxWrapper, edit the .ini file and enable the settings wanted.  See the [Configuration wiki](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/wiki/Configuration) for more details.

Sample configuration file: [dxwrapper.ini](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/blob/master/Settings/Settings.ini).

List of all configuration options: [allsettings.ini](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/blob/master/Settings/AllSettings.ini)

### Logging
The log file will be created in the same folder where the game executable is located.  It will be named 'dxwrapper' with the name of the game executable appended to it.  So if you are running the file `game.exe` then the log file will be called `dxwrapper-game.log`.

### Supported DLLs

DxWrapper can wrap the following dlls:
 - bcrypt.dll

### Development
DxWrapper is written mostly in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.

The project requires both the Windows 10 SDK and WDK (needs to have matching SDK and WDK versions installed). The exact version required can be seen in the project properties in Visual Studio.
