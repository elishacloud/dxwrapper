# DxWrapper
### Introduction
DxWrapper is a .dll file designed to wrap DirectX files to fix compatibility issues in older games.  This project is primarily targeted at fixing issues with running games on Windows 10/11, by simply dropping .dll and .ini files into the game folder.  Its secondary purpose is to offer a single tool combining several projects into one.

### Features

DxWrapper includes a wide range of features:

#### üéÆ Major Graphics Conversion and Enhancement
- **DirectDraw/Direct3D 1‚Äì7 to Direct3D 9** conversion via [Dd7to9](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/wiki/DirectDraw-to-Direct3D9-Conversion)
- **Direct3D 8 to Direct3D 9** conversion via [d3d8to9](https://github.com/crosire/d3d8to9)
- **Direct3D 9 hooking** to intercept and enhance graphics calls
- **DirectInput 1‚Äì7 to DirectInput 8** conversion via [dinputto8](https://github.com/elishacloud/dinputto8)
- **DirectSound hooking** (`dsound.dll`), similar to [DSoundCtrl](http://www.bockholdt.com/dsc/), to enhance or fix audio
- **[DDrawCompat](https://github.com/narzoul/DDrawCompat) integration** (v2.0, 2.1, 3.2) for improved compatibility with configurable options

#### üñ•Ô∏è Resolution and Renderer Enhancements
- **Resolution unlock** for Direct3D 1‚Äì7 using [LegacyD3DResolutionHack](https://github.com/UCyborg/LegacyD3DResolutionHack) ‚Äî enables 4K and beyond
- **Direct3D 9 to Direct3D9Ex** conversion for enhanced rendering performance
- **Direct3D 9 to Direct3D 12** conversion via [D3D9On12](https://github.com/microsoft/D3D9On12)

#### üõ†Ô∏è Rendering and Compatibility Fixes
- **Clip plane caching** to fix issues in D3D9 games ([Far Cry example](https://houssemnasri.github.io/2018/07/07/farcry-d3d9-bug/))
- **Environment cube map fixes** for broken textures ([issue example](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/issues/136))
- **Vertex processing mode override** to fix performance issues
- **Scanline removal** from games that display them
- **Interlacing removal** to improve visual quality

#### üß© Rendering Enhancements (Forced Features)
- **Force anti-aliasing** support in games that don't support it natively
- **Force anisotropic filtering** in unsupported games
- **Force vertical sync (VSync)** on or off
- **Force windowed mode** in fullscreen-only games
- **Force use of discrete GPU** (dGPU) via `GraphicsHybridAdapter` call
- **Force single Begin/EndScene pair** per Present call (per Microsoft documentation)

#### üéõÔ∏è Frame and Timing Control
- **FPS limiter** to prevent games from running too fast
- **Performance counter patching** to fake uptime < 1 day (fixes long-uptime issues)
- **Single CPU affinity** setting for multi-core compatibility issues
- **Application Compatibility Toolkit settings override** for `DXPrimaryEmulation`:
  - Includes: `LockEmulation`, `BltEmulation`, `ForceLockNoWindow`, `ForceBltNoWindow`, `LockColorkey`, `FullscreenWithDWM`, `DisableLockEmulation`, `EnableOverlays`, `DisableSurfaceLocks`, `RedirectPrimarySurfBlts`, `StripBorderStyle`, `DisableMaxWindowedMode`

#### üìê Compatibility and GDI Fixes
- **GDI and DirectDraw mixing support** to improve 2D compatibility
- **Pitch lock fix** for games with misaligned surfaces
- **Disable Fullscreen Optimizations (MaximizedWindowedMode)** to resolve performance/stability issues
- **Disable High DPI scaling** to fix UI scaling issues
- **Disable Microsoft Game Explorer (GameUX)** to stop `rundll32.exe` CPU spikes
- **Disable audio clipping** to eliminate pops and clicks during playback

#### üîß Advanced Customization and Modding
- **Hot-patch memory** in real time (e.g., remove CD checks or fix bugs)
- **Set Windows version** seen by game (helps with OS compatibility)
- **Handle in-game crashes** by patching problematic instructions (nop'ing offending code)
- **Launch custom processes** when the game starts
- **Load custom `.dll` files** into game processes
- **ASI loader** to inject `.asi` plug-ins ([Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) compatible)
- **DxWrapper as an ASI plug-in** (can be loaded by other ASI loaders)

#### üß© Miscellaneous Fixes and Tweaks
- **Set game window to fullscreen** (if native fullscreen fails)
- **Show FPS counter** in-game
- **Filter input** when the game window loses focus (prevents input when other windows are active)
- **Various compatibility flags and tweaks**, including:
  - `DdrawEmulateSurface`, `DdrawEmulateLock`, `DdrawKeepAllInterfaceCache`, `DdrawLimitTextureFormats`, `DdrawLimitDisplayModeCount`, `LimitStateBlocks`, `SetPOW2Caps`

### Compatibility List for Games on Windows 10/11
So far I have tested this with hundreds of games (many of which  don't otherwise work correctly) to get them running on Windows 10/11.  Most games will work, but some still have issues.  Check out the [Compatible Games wiki](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/wiki/Compatible-Games) and the [Dd7to9 Supported Games wiki](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/wiki/DirectDraw-to-Direct3D9-Conversion#supported-2d-games-directdraw) for a list.

### Installation

1. Download the latest binary release from the repository's [Release](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/releases) page and unzip it to a folder.
2. Determine which stub .dll file is needed for the game.  This depends on many factors which will be explained on page created later.  Common stub dll's to use are `ddraw.dll`, `d3d8.dll`, `d3d9.dll`, `dsound.dll` or `winmm.dll`.  You only need to choose one stub file to load dxwrapper into the game.
3. Copy this .dll file from the 'Stub' folder plus the `dxwrapper.dll` and `dxwrapper.ini` files into the game's installation directory, next to the main executable file.  For some games the main executable is in a subdirectory (like 'Bin', 'Exe' or 'App') so the files will need to be copied it into that directory.  Overwriting of any existing game files is not recommended.
4. Open up the `dxwrapper.ini` file in a text editor and enable the settings needed for the game.

Do not attempt to overwrite any .dll in a Windows system directory as it is currently not supported and will not work.

### Uninstallation

Delete the DxWrapper .dll and .ini files from the game's directory. You can also delete the log file, if there is one.

### Configuration

To configure DxWrapper, edit the .ini file and enable the settings wanted.  See the [Configuration wiki](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/wiki/Configuration) for more details.

Sample configuration file: [dxwrapper.ini](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/blob/master/Settings/Settings.ini).

List of all configuration options: [allsettings.ini](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper/blob/master/Settings/AllSettings.ini)

### Logging
The log file will be created in the same folder where the game executable is located.  It will be named 'dxwrapper' with the name of the game executable appended to it.  So if you are running the file `game.exe` then the log file will be called `dxwrapper-game.log`.

### Supported DLLs

 - bcrypt.dll
